# Portfolio

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jacob Roling and I'm a web developer from Adelaide, South Australia. Welcome to my portfolio. I built it using a variety of technologies. For the frontend I used SvelteKit. My projects, skills and experience are all data that is being pulled from Firebase. The website uses SSR so if you view the source code on the home page you will notice that the projects are prerendered in the HTML. The website is styled with Tailwind. The contact form uses EmailJS to deliver contact details to my email address and the site is hosted on Firebase CDN.
